Today, I was feeling to give up tech subjects and goes with some notes I did about emotional intelligence.
As you guessed from the title, we are going to talk about relationship between men and woman. 
Sometime, it feels that your relationship is getting harder and harder. You and you partner are incapable to
speak to each other. It looks like a never ending loop.

Today's topic is very much linked with the book of _Daniel Goleman_.

Maybe to understand what is happening right now, we should go back to the childhood and how we are educated.

# Education

Before we started, I would like to make it clear. I **don't like to put people in box** and everybody must be the same.
So, let's assume that I am going to refer to the majority of the person with some shades.

## Girls and Boys

**Girls** are educated to talk about their emotions. They are specialised to decrypt any verbal or non-verbal signals
and to express their feelings. They belong to a network of relationship.

Meanwhile **boys** must be tough and independent. They tend to minimise any emotion linked to some weakness such as 
vulnerability, guilt, fear and sadness.

Just have a look at school playground and observe ! 

# Couple

We are now adults. We are going to explore our differences as men and woman.

## Men vs Woman

What seems to be essentials in a relationship : 
- **woman** -> communication
- **men** -> do activities together

Men see their relationship (sex, finance, life...) in a more optimist way than woman. They see the state of the relationship  more **"rose"** than the woman.

## What behaviours matter the most ?

The way the spouses discuss sensibles questions are **crucials** for a couple. In a relationship _(in life in general)_, somebody with emotional intelligence
speaks with **confidence** without aggressiveness and passiveness.

### Attasks and defences

However, the personal blame, in particular if it is followed by a "general attack" against the spouse will provocate a defensive reaction.

> **_NOTE:_** More dose of **contempt** there **is**, more **destructive** it will be.
> _Plus, you may also add the facial movement that goes with contempt and disgust!_

For the spouse, it's a permanent condemnation. He/She has only two options:
1. Flee aka **Silence**
2. **Fight** with a sterile counteroffencive

After a while, painful thoughts become automatic and self-reinforcing. As a result, any act of kindness which can
challenge his/her ways of seeing things is minimized or ignored. A good intention is badly read.

### What does it mean for men and woman ?

_Men_ are looking to **avoid** emotional related conflicts with as much enthusiasm as _women_ want to **provocate** them.

> Women make critisms easily. Men act like a wall of silence!

# What can you do ?

Both parties need to learn to calm down. The book from _Daniel Goleman_ gives clues to achieve that.

## Men

Men should:
* **stop** avoiding conflict
* be mindful and in empathy with **his feelings**

## Women

Woman should:
* **avoid personal criticism** and contempt
* share her in a larger context
* share **her love**

## Both

Be careful while arguing! You should: 
* stick to the topic of the conversation
* show **empathy**
* reduce the tension

# Conclusion

This was notes taken while reading the book about _Emotional Intelligence_. I hope you find it useful and take care!
