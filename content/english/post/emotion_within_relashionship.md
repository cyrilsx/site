Today, I was feeling to give up tech subjects and goes with some notes I did about emotional intelligence.
As you guessed from the title, we are going to talk about relationship between men and woman. 
Sometime, it feels that your relationship is getting harder and harder. You and you partner are incappable to
speak to each other. It looks like a never ending loop.

Today's topic is very much linked with the book of _Daniel Goleman_.

Maybe to understand what is happening right now, we should go back to the childhood and how we are educated.

# Education

Before we started, I would like to make it clear. I **don't like to put people in box** and everybody must be the same.
So, let's assume that I am going to refer to the majority of the person with some shades.

## Girls and Boys

**Girls** are educated to talk about their emotions. They are specialised to decrypt any verbal or non-verbal signals
and to express their feelings. They belong to a network of relationship.

Meanwhile **boys** must be tough and independent. They tend to minimise any emotion linked to some weakness such as 
vulnerability, guilt, fear and sadness.

Just have a look at school playground and observe ! 

# Couple

We are now adults. We are going to explore our differences as men and woman.

## Men vs Woman

What seems to be essentials in a relationship : 
- **woman** -> communication
- **men** -> do activities together

Men see their relationship (sex, finance, life...) in a more optimist way than woman. They see life more **"rose"** than the woman.
