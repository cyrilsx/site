This is another article about something that I read lately. This is an old post from the `Havard Business Review`. 
Research has shown how focus is an important factor for success. Along with research, a ton of distraction free applications for mobile phone and desktop have become popular. But there is a little gem hidden in distraction. 
A little warning though, don't use this evening to excuse all your distractions.

# The problem of excessive focus

# Keep meditating
It's crucial to be able to stay focus and activities such as meditation or yoga are always beneficials.

Practicing mindfulness every day as a routine helps to be more conscious of your emotions and teach you how make sense your past experiences.

I didn't practice ton of yoga. However I love the link between body and mind while exercising.

A final though to be in mind, meditation, yoga and a good sleep are always better than a coffee or any energy drink for focus proposed. 

For pleasure, I am also going to a nice coffee.â™¥
