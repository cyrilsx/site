This is another article about something that I read lately. This is an old post from the `Havard Business Review`. 
Research has shown how focus is an important factor for success. Along with research, a ton of distraction free applications for mobile phone and desktop have become popular. But there is a little gem hidden in distraction. 
A little warning though, don't use this evening to excuse all your distractions.
