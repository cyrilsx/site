This is another article about something that I read lately. This is an old post from the `Harvard Business Review`. 
Research has shown how focus is an important factor for success. Along with research, a ton of distraction free applications for mobile phone and desktop have become popular. But there is a little gem hidden in distraction. 
A little warning though, don't use this evening to excuse all your distractions.

# The problem of excessive focus
Excessive focus exhausts the focus circuit.Too much focus can result of too energy consumption. The consequences can make **lose self-control, lead to impulsive behaviour and less helpful.** You become less cooperative and your decision becomes poorly thought.

# Keep meditating
It's crucial to be able to stay focus and activities such as meditation or yoga are always beneficials.

Practicing mindfulness every day as a routine helps to be more conscious of your emotions and teach you how make sense your past experiences.

I didn't practice ton of yoga. However I love the link between body and mind while exercising.

A final though to be in mind, meditation, yoga and a good sleep are always better than a coffee or any energy drink for focus proposed. 

For pleasure, I am also going to a nice coffee.â™¥ 
  
# Positive constructive daydreaming
When you are not focus, your brain turn on his Default Mode Network (DMN)._This mode use 20% of the body energy, not bad for doing nothing_.

In reality, it's not rest. During this period, it activates old memory, go back and forward between the past, the present and the future. Suddenly, it starts to have imagination and creativity. It's probably during these moments that amazing ideas rise. First, you should imagine something joyful/playful such as running in the wood, lying on the beach or relaxing with a coffee in the morning. Then you keep yourself from the outside world and stay inside your mind with your joyful image while doing your low-key activity.

There are 3 ways to activate this circuit.

## Positive daydreaming
Daydreaming is going to re-energize your brain and boost your creativity.

You can do an activity that doesn't require focus such as gardening or reading a casual book. During this activity, your mind will start walking around thoughts.

## Taking nap
When you brain is overloaded, your clarity and creativity is compromised. Studies show that after 10 minutes nap, you become clearer and more alert. If you have to go for a more intense task, you can go for 90 minutes.

I personnaly go for mini-nap. It's enough for me and it avoid a long wake up time.


## Pretending to be someone else 
Two educational psychologists (Denis Dumas and Kevin Dunbar) found that people can be more sucessful to problem's solving if you imagine to be a crazy genuis artist instead of being a strict librarian.

# Conclusion
I hope it can make you feel better to take some short break in order to make you more productive and creative afterwards.
